# Problem Solving

More often than not, you will be given a description of a problem and be required to understand how it can be solved in terms of computing.

The key is to be patient and read the specifications carefully. Skipping sections because you think they are not important is the biggest mistake you can make (I've done it a few times too :pensive:)

We will try to understand problem solving through examples. We will be tackling some of the HackerRank challenges
